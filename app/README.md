# 🚀 FastAPI Fullstack Boilerplate (beta)

A **lean, modern full-stack boilerplate** for building real products fast — without overengineering or heavy infrastructure.

Built for **solo developers, freelancers, and small teams** who want a codebase that is **easy to understand, easy to change, and fast to ship**.

---

## 🎯 What This Is

* ⚡ **Minimal-infra** FastAPI + React setup
* 🧠 Opinionated, but **not rigid**
* 🛠 Optimized for **MVPs, client work, and early-stage products**
* 🔧 Built to be **modified**, not worshipped

If you usually delete half a boilerplate on day one — this starts closer to what you actually need.

## 🧩 Core Stack

### 🖥 Backend

* ⚙️ **FastAPI** — async, explicit, readable
* 🐘 **PostgreSQL** — SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic

* 🔐 **JWT Auth** — simple, replaceable
* 🤖 **CI Ready** — Ruff, Mypy, Pytest (GitHub Actions)

### 🎨 Frontend

* ⚛️ **React** — clean setup, no framework lock-in
* 🧪 **Testing Included**

  * 🎭 **Playwright** — end-to-end tests
  * 🧩 **React Testing Library** — component tests
* 🧹 Tests are easy to write — and easy to remove

## 🧠 Design Principles

* 🪶 **Low infrastructure cost**
* 🧱 **Few moving parts**
* 📖 **Readable over clever**
* 🚀 **Fast local development**
